Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?: 10, 100, and 1000 are incorrect since the answers are unstable.

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?: It seems like the predictions stabilized after about 10000
